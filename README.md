# **MR. TENORI**
#### Live demo at [mrtenori.com](http://mrtenori.com).

This here is a beautiful recreation of the Yamaha Tenori-On. New features are being implemented weekly on the development branch. Currently planned features include:
- MIDI file export of loops
- increasing and decreasing loop length for different time signatures and compositions
- changing number of notes in range
- pretty graphics showing which notes are being played
- sexier interface for the synth...

Made public September 5th, 2019. It is a work in progress!
